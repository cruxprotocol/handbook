# CRUX Protocol


## Abstract
CRUX is the User Experience Layer between Users and the world of cryptocurrencies & dApps.
CRUX is designed to drastically lower the barrier of entry for users into the blockchain ecosystem.

CRUX achieves this with 3 components:  
1. CRUX Identity - A globally unique, human-readable secure identity stored in a User's wallet.  
2. CRUXPay Protocol - Pay to a human readable name. Unified experience across cryptocurrencies.   
3. CRUXGateway Protocol - Seamless interoperability between Wallets, dApps and Conventional Services.   



## Motivation & Problem

### Actors
[diagram]
1. Users
Persons who want to send cryptocurrencies to other Persons
Persons who want to use a dApp
Persons who want to send money to a retailer

2. Wallets
Users trust Wallets with their Private Keys. 
Gateway to the Blockchain

3. Blockchain
Transmit value securely to another entity.
Securely execute business logic.

4. Services
Any use cases which involve interaction with the Blockchain. 
Broad classification can be broken as - dApps, exchanges, merchants, games etc.

### Interactions

#### Scene 1 - UWB UWB
[diagram]
Problem - addresses suck, remembering addresses is tough.
its not like phone number. bank account. but worse. 
Things people need to know that they shouldn't need to no
Address types, segwit non segwit, currency forks, symbol confusion
wrong address input, 

#### Scene 2 - USB UWB
[diagram]
Problem - 1. need a wallet in my browser 2. input address
Sergice Talk to wallet
I need metamask. Onboarding is tough. If I already have a wallet.
Future is towards multi-currency wallets because its easy. Why do I need a separate wallet.
